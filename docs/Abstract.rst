Background
----------
In the 21st century, intense road construction all over the world is anticipated. By one estimate (REF), the summed length of roads in the period 2010 - 2050 will increase by 60 %. Much of this road construction will be going on in rural/forested areas.

Motivations for road construction are diverse, as are the repercussions. Properly planned roads foster economic development (think usage of natural ressources), whereas arbitrarily built roads serving only one-sided interest (think illegal logging) both cause and indicate many negative effects like environmental destruction.

Any agency involved in planning land use and conservation management can make informed decisions based on a precise knowledge of the status quo. Herein, however, lies the problem. Right now, there a dearth of information on road networks, particularly in rural areas, and particularly concerning the kind of road (paved vs. unpaved). The reason is that road maps of such areas must be created by human volunteers as there are virtually no automated methods of detecting roads.
