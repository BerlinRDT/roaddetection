Road detection and classification in satellite images
=====================================================

Portfolio Project by Lisa Hesse & Harald Hentschke, Data Science Retreat Berlin (Batch 15)

Roadmap/To-do list
------------------
* get examples of satellite imagery with labels (training set): selected areas in Indonesia (Sumatra and Borneo)
* clarify which images had best be used for the task: if from different satellites, there may be problems because an algorithm tuned to images from one satellite may not be the best for those from a different satellite

Copernicus satellite info (from Wikipedia)

* Sentinel-1 will provide all-weather, day and night radar imaging for land and ocean services. The first Sentinel-1A satellite was successfully launched on 3 April 2014, by an Arianespace Soyuz, from the Guyana Space Center;.[9] The second Sentinel-1B satellite was launched on 25 April 2016 from same spaceport. 
* Sentinel-2 will provide high-resolution optical imaging for land services (e.g. imagery of vegetation, soil and water cover, inland waterways and coastal areas). Sentinel-2 will also provide information for emergency services. The first Sentinel-2 satellite has successfully launched on 23 June 2015.[10] 
* Sentinel-3 will provide ocean and global land monitoring services. The first Sentinel-3A satellite was launched on 16 January 2016 by a Eurockot Rokot vehicle from the Plesetsk Cosmodrome in Russia;[11][12]
