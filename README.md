In the 21st century, intense road construction in rural areas all over the world is anticipated. A substantial part of these activities will affect environmentally sensitive areas, occur in an unplanned manner, and remain off the charts due to the absence of efficient ways of monitoring road construction. Inspired by a recent appeal to the AI community (Laurance, W. F. Road mapping needs AI experts. Nature 558, 30; 2018), we present a deep learning model designed for detecting roads in satellite imagery from rural areas, and for discriminating between paved and unpaved roads. Road labels in selected areas of Southeastern Borneo were kindly provided by the group of Prof. Laurance (James Cook University, Australia), and were also retrieved from OpenStreetMaps and generated by us. 
This Portfolio Project is part of a three-month intensive training at Data Science Retreat, Berlin (Batch #15, June 18 - September 13, 2018)
